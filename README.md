# React Hooks

This is my first react package that I display for the community. I have using this on my projects since I have learned to use React. By this I mean, that the overall hooks of this package, has been moduled by a time since then. I'll really appreciete if you guys give me a feedback, pull request or whatever. All hooks has been made by using Next.js in mind.

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install @vorlefan/react-hooks
```

With [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) do:

```
yarn add @vorlefan/react-hooks
```
