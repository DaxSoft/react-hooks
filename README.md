## Introduction

*@vorlefan/react-hooks* is my first package that I have build for React. It's come from the needs of my person when creating a website that uses (Next.js). I was requiring hooks that works well in both server/client side. 

And to take a good learning from this, I have decided to create this package with TypeScript, since I never used it xD.
I shall really thank you, dear visitor, if you can provide me with feedbacks (issues and pull request).
